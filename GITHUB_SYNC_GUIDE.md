# GitHub Sync Guide for CaringIQ Landing Page

## Quick Start

I've prepared your project for GitHub sync. Here's exactly what to do:

### Option 1: Using the Setup Script (Recommended)

1. Run the setup script:
   ```bash
   ./setup-github.sh
   ```

2. Follow the instructions it provides.

### Option 2: Manual Setup

#### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the "+" button → "New repository"
3. Repository name: `caringiq-landing-page` (or your preference)
4. Description: "Modern landing page for CaringIQ's AI-powered caregiving platform"
5. Choose Public or Private
6. **Don't** check "Initialize with README" (we already have files)
7. Click "Create repository"

#### Step 2: Connect and Push
GitHub will show you commands. Use these in your terminal:

```bash
# Add all files to staging
git add .

# Create initial commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: CaringIQ landing page with waitlist and contact forms"

# Add GitHub repository as origin (replace with your URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/caringiq-landing-page.git

# Set main branch and push
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

#### Step 3: Verify
- Go to your GitHub repository
- You should see all your files there
- The README.md will display automatically
